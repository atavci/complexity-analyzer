# Code Complexity Analyzer

## Introduction

The Code Complexity Analyzer is a web application designed to analyze and calculate the time and space complexity of a given code piece in big O notation. It provides users with a detailed explanation of the complexity, helping them understand how efficient their code is and how to optimize it for better performance.

## Features

- Supports multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, C#, you name it..)
- Calculates time complexity in big O notation
- Calculates space complexity in big O notation
- Provides a detailed explanation of the calculated complexity

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari)
- A stable internet connection

### Using the application

1. Visit the Complexity Analyzer website at [https://complexity-analyzer.vercel.app/](https://complexity-analyzer.vercel.app/).
2. Copy and paste your code into the input field.
3. Click the 'Analyze' button.
5. The web app will process your code and display the results, including the time complexity, space complexity, and a detailed explanation.

## Understanding the Results

The results will include the following information:

- **Time Complexity:** The number of operations the code takes as a function of its input size (n).
- **Space Complexity:** The amount of memory the code consumes as a function of its input size (n).
- **Detailed Explanation:** A step-by-step breakdown of how the complexity was calculated, including the identification of loops, function calls, and other factors affecting the code's performance.
